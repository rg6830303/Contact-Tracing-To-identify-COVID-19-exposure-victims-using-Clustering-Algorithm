The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for effective contact tracing systems capable of identifying and managing exposure clusters to mitigate virus transmission. Traditional contact tracing approaches, while valuable, face limitations in scalability and real-time analysis, particularly in large populations. This study proposes a machine learning-based contact tracing framework that not only tracks individual exposures but also identifies potential COVID-19 exposure clusters through pattern recognition and predictive modeling techniques.
The proposed system leverages proximity data collected via Bluetooth and combines it with temporal and spatial patterns of interactions to create a comprehensive risk profile for each user. Using unsupervised clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and hierarchical clustering, the system detects high-density exposure clusters in real time, identifying hotspots where COVID-19 transmission is most likely to occur. Furthermore, a supervised learning model is employed to classify exposure risk levels, accounting for factors like proximity duration, environmental context, and known infection rates in specific locations.
Machine learning (ML) has become an invaluable tool in epidemiology, transforming the way diseases are tracked, analyzed, and controlled. In the context of infectious diseases, ML algorithms are used to identify patterns in large datasets, predict disease outbreaks, and assess the risk of exposure. One of the most significant applications of ML is in the modeling of disease transmission dynamics, where algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and neural networks are used to analyze factors such as population mobility, environmental conditions, and human behavior to predict the spread of infections. ML techniques are also applied in surveillance systems to detect early signs of outbreaks by analyzing healthcare data, such as hospital admissions and lab test results, to identify unusual patterns that may indicate an emerging epidemic.
In contact tracing, ML plays a crucial role in processing and analyzing large volumes of proximity data to detect clusters of exposure, classify risk levels, and optimize quarantine measures. Clustering algorithms like DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and K-means are used to group individuals who have had close contact in high-risk environments, while supervised learning models are employed to predict the likelihood of infection based on contact frequency, duration, and proximity. Moreover, ML can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions by modeling different scenarios and providing insights into the most effective strategies for controlling disease spread.
